I got this project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
. While the project asks you to implement certain functionalities, I added some that I thought could be useful to make the code more reusable and dynamic.

These are the project goals:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
